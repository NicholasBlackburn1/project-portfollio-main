## Introduction

Hey there, fellow fur enthusiasts! ðŸ¦Š Welcome to an exciting journey into the wild world of AI and furries. Today, we're diving into my latest project, Fursona of the Wild, where we're building a deep neural network (DNN) model using OpenCV to recognize furries in the wild (FITW). Whether you're a tech-savvy fur or just curious about the magic behind furry recognition, this project has something for everyone.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of **Fursona of the Wild** are:

- **Create a DNN Model**: Develop a deep neural network model for OpenCV that can accurately recognize furries in various environments.

- **Learn and Improve**: Gain hands-on experience in creating both a detector model and a recognition model, enhancing my skills along the way.
- **Furry Community Contribution**: Provide the furry community with a customized recognition system based on fursuits, making it easier to identify and celebrate our unique characters.
- **Optimize Performance**: Train, learn, and improve the model's accuracy and speed to match the performance of advanced models like YOLO V4, but tailored specifically for furries.

## Training the Model

All the data used for training this model comes from <a href="http://furtrack.com">`Furtrack`</a>, a comprehensive furry fursona database. I used a custom web scraper to gather single furry shots from the site, ensuring a diverse and rich dataset for training.

## Data Structure

The dataset is meticulously organized into folders based on species, with each folder `containing around 300 images`. This organization helps in creating precise classifications for each different species of furries.


## Managing blog posts

I highly recommend the [Front Matter VS Code extension](https://frontmatter.codes/) to manage blog posts. It gives you a nice CMS-like UI to manage the front matter of all blog posts, as well as a preview of their content. It is, of course, optional, and you can manage everything directly in the Markdown files if you prefer.
